Alpha support for Spotify, via. libdespotify.

  * libspotify / Spotify Core fails horribly due to:
          http://getsatisfaction.com/spotify/topics/libspotify_crashes_on_loading_access_violation 
      Please let the Spotify authors know what you think about this.

Known issues:
  * Will just deadlock if you use any plugins that require concurrent decoding (i.e. foo_wave_seekbar (Damn you, Zao!)).
  * Built in debug mode (-> ugly messagebox when you start foobar2000) (don't even ask)
  * Dynamically linked (mingw bleh)
  * Seeking support is gone.  Despotify doesn't support seek.
  * No password field for password
  * Barely any error checking (i.e. getting your password or account type wrong -> apparently not a track)
  * Sometimes tracks skip instead of waiting to buffer
